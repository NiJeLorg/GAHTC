		<h1>Current Members</h1>
		<p>GAHTC membership is based upon the principle of community and collaboration. We currently have over 200 members from all
			over the world, of various ranks and disciplines. Of those members, 68 are contributing members, with content in the GAHTC
			library. Over the next three years, the GAHTC's aim is to provide opportunity, through its various grant options, for
			members to share their research and knowledge with the GAHTC community, and our GAHTC community. As membership continues
			to grow,, so will our community, and our network. Join GAHTC and receive access to some of the best architectural history
			survey courses covering a diverse set of topics and regions. GAHTC members are eligible to apply for research funding,
			travel funding, and workshop funding, as well as funded attendance to the Member's Conference to collaborate, interact
			and innovate with fellow global scholars. Questions?

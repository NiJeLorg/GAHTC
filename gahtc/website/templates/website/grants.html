				Phase two of the GAHTC will dedicate nearly $500,000 to building new content, and will do so through a multi-pronged plan towards research and professional expansion. To that end, GAHTC2 will include six new grant funding opportunities. <a href="#targeted-acquisition-grants">Targeted Acquisition Grants</a>, <a href="#untargeted-field-initiated-grants">Untargeted Field-initiated Grants</a>, <a href="#emerging-scholar-grants">Emerging Scholar Grants</a>, <a href="#global-connections-fellowship">Global Connections Fellowship</a>, <a href="#research-to-teaching-grants">Research-to-Teaching Grants</a> in affiliation with SAH, and <a href="#travel-grants">Field Seminar Travel Grants</a>, also in affiliation with SAH.

			<p class="backToTopLink"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
			<p>
				The Global Architectural History Teaching Collaborative, in connection with SAH and MIT is pleased to introduce a grant for the Targeted Acquisition of teaching materials able to address potential gaps in the GAHTC library. The grant is intended to elevate, strengthen and make more accessible a global perspective of architectural history. GAHTC is generously supported by the Andrew W. Mellon foundation.
			</p>
			<p>
				To ensure the most diverse library of teaching content, and to provide high quality curated teaching materials at the survey level, the GAHTC has established a research fund for <em>Targeted Acquisition Grants</em>. In recognition of the need to continue to build new knowledge in the architectural history of the world, the GAHTC has identified areas in its library in need of expansion. To that end, the collaborative seeks the contribution of scholars able to share their research and knowledge through compelling lectures that enrich the library, connect the leading researchers in the field to the GAHTC initiative, and provide instructors with content that they find engaging, timely and inspirational to teach. <em>Targeted acquisitions</em> will supplement well the GAHTC's current library of nearly 200 lectures, all produced to strengthen and elevate the global perspective within programs teaching architectural history.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each grantee will receive $12,000 to $40,000 to produce lectures for use at the survey level. The GAHTC will fund each author $3,000 per lecture.
			</p>
			<p>
				The GAHTC welcomes submissions related, but not limited to the following areas of study:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sub-Saharan Architecture and Space</li>
				<li>Polynesian Architecture and Culture</li>
				<li>Russian Architecture</li>
				<li>Global Islamic Architecture and Culture</li>
				<li>PreModern Europe</li>
				<li>Aboriginal Sacred Landscapes</li>

			<h3 id="untargeted-field-initiated-grants">Untargeted Field-Initiated Grants for Teaching Modules from Expanded Membership</h3>
			<p class="backToTopLink"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
			<p>
				The Global Architectural History Teaching Collaborative, in connection with SAH and MIT is pleased to introduce a grant for the <em>Untargeted Field-Initiated Grants for Teaching Modules</em> able to supplement the well-established GAHTC library. The grant is intended to elevate, strengthen and make more accessible a global perspective of architectural history. GAHTC is generously supported by the Andrew W. Mellon foundation.
			</p>
			<p>
				The GAHTC has established a fund for four untargeted grants. Grantees will be awarded $2,000 per lecture produced on a topic that is beyond the targeted list of research, and is as such an unanticipated, but welcome addition to the teaching library. The GAHTC will fund four Untargeted Field-Initiated grants.

			<h3 id="emerging-scholar-grants">Emerging Scholars Grants</h3>
			<p class="backToTopLink"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
			<p>
				The Global Architectural History Teaching Collaborative, in connection with SAH and MIT is pleased to introduce a grant for the <em>Emerging Scholars</em>, targeted towards pre-tenure scholars. The grant is intended to elevate, strengthen and make more accessible a global perspective of architectural history. GAHTC is generously supported by the Andrew W. Mellon foundation. The GAHTC will privilege pre-tenure scholars, current members and content users. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The GAHTC has established a fund for four Emerging Scholar Grants. The intention of this grant is to foster the innovation and technique of emerging scholars by allowing them to build upon GAHTC material in some way that suits their particular institutional need and then return that material to GAHTC as part of its available repository of courses able to supplement the well-established GAHTC library. The goal of this grant is to work with those teachers on the very front line of curriculum transformations, and, through the circulation of teaching materials, developing feedback within the teaching community.
			</p>
			<p>
				The GAHTC has established a fund for the Emerging Scholars Grant. Each grantee will be awarded $2,000 per lecture to be added to the GAHTC library. The GAHTC will fund fifteen Emerging Scholar grants.

			<h3 id="global-connections-fellowship">Global Connections Fellowship</h3>
			<p class="backToTopLink"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
			<p>
				The Global Architectural History Teaching Collaborative is pleased to introduce the <em>Global Connections Fellowship</em>, targeted towards a group of scholars interested in expanding the scope of their research and sites of study. The grant is intended to elevate, strengthen and make more accessible a global perspective of architectural history. GAHTC is supported by the Andrew W. Mellon foundation.
			</p>
			<p>
				These fellowships seeks to establish sustainable relationships with universities outside the U.S., while also visiting new sites of research, as a form of resistance against the dominant Euro-American narrative in Architectural History. This fellowship is intended to inspire a collaborative, innovative, interdisciplinary, but, most importantly, global inquiry into an underrepresented region of study. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This research fellowship will fund the travel of several groups of scholars, from various ranks and institutions.The goal of this grant is to enable a collaborative opportunity for scholars to visit a country that they have never before been to. Ideally the team will solicit the participation of one member with local expertise in the intended site of study.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also ideal is that the members of each team be of varied academic rank, from different but allied disciplines, and from at least two different institutions. Each team will receive funding for research and travel, as well as $2,000 per lecture, to produce a new survey module to add to the GAHTC library.

			<h1>Architecture Talk<br><small>The GAHTC Podcast</small></h1>
			<p>
				The objective of these podcasts is to ‘introduce’ various modules of the GAHTC by hearing the voice of their primary authors in conversation. Rather than a ‘summary’ of the contents of the Module, the podcast will engage the ‘voice’ of the team leader, with the objective of gaining a sense of the underlying intentions and interests of the module. This should help establish the intellectual quest of GAHTC, as the search for new epistemic horizons, along with the teaching materials themselves.

				<strong>The first sample podcast is complete and ready! More to follow. </strong>
